# Thesis
This project was developed as a Master's thesis for the Data Science and Advanced Analytics program at NOVA IMS. It utilized the real Petrobras 3W dataset, which includes instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables (Vargas et al., 2019). This unique dataset, representing naturally flowing oil wells, was validated by industry experts who invested significant time to verify historical events and generate simulated and hand-drawn instances to address data imbalance under varying operating conditions. 
For the project two algorithms were selected, which are Recurrent Neural Network configurations with LSTM and GRU architectures. Further, Genetic Algorithms were employed for hyperparameters optimization.
