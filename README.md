NOVA IMS Masters thesis
This project is developed as a Masters thesis for NOVA IMS. The real Petrobras 3W dataset was used for this research, which has instances of eight types of undesirable events characterized by eight process variables (Vargas et al., 2019). It is a unique dataset of naturally flowing oil wells, for which industry experts spend extensive amount of time to validate historical events and produce simulated and hand-drawn instances, that are useful to counterpart data imbalance, under different operating conditions.
For the project two algorithms were selected, which are Recurrent Neural Network configurations with LSTM and GRU architectures. Further, Genetic Algorithms were applied for hyperparameters optimization.
